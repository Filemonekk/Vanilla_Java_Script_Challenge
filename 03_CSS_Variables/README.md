# Scoped CSS Variables and JS

This project demonstrates how to update CSS variables dynamically using JavaScript. It includes a simple interface where users can adjust spacing, blur, and base color using sliders and color pickers. These changes immediately reflect in the CSS properties of an image and text.

## ðŸŽ® Demo
You can see the app in action here: [CSS_Variables](https://filemonekk.github.io/30_Days_JS_Challenge/CSS_Variables)

## Features

- Adjust spacing around the image using a range input.
- Apply a blur effect to the image dynamically.
- Change the base color for the background and text.
- CSS variables are updated in real-time using JavaScript.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for structure.
- **CSS3** for styling, including custom CSS variables.
- **JavaScript** for DOM manipulation and dynamically updating CSS properties.

## How It Works

1. **HTML Structure**: Contains controls (range sliders and color input) and an image.
2. **CSS Variables**: Declared in the `:root` selector to set base color, spacing, and blur values.
3. **JavaScript**: Adds event listeners to the input elements, updating the CSS variables based on user interaction.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open index.html in a browser.
3. Adjust the sliders and color picker to see live updates in spacing, blur, and color.
